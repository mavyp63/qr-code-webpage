## My process
  I started with HTML, using it to create my box(div), input the text and the picture as well. Before using CSS to style it all up into what it is now, started withe the background color, the div, text & image size, before finally positioning it all

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- creation of div
- Styling with CSS

### What I learned

I learnt how to create a nice and responsive webpage on my first try

### Continued development

I would like to focus on the areas of using HTML & CSS better for now, like to create, design beautiful websites and webpages and later go into javascript, json, react, e.t.c to make more beautiful and responsive webpages
